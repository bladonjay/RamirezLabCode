For the Ramirez lab
 This repo has two bodies of code:
 1. Stellas VTA experiment, probalby has dependenceis lying in general-repo
 
 2. Kaitlyns Exercise experiment: this also has the general-repo depenencies
 
 Each repo has a function to run the IO with the arduino microcontrollers
 that run the rigs, and a quick analysis function to examine the datafiles coming off
 of these rigs.
